<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello My name is Yash I am from Bangalore India, I started working on Webdevelopment just recently and i found it very satisfying to code, I was always good at coding except when they introduced math into the picture haha, I hope we wont have to do ny math here in Web development Look forward to building more beautiful websites and expand my own portfolios further than the stars. may the force be with me.</p>

<p>A lil bit about myself, I am an only child but i wasnt coddled or given all i wanted My parents were truly asian, codeled when i was good and gave a stern talking in my case " heavy belt whopping " LOL, Grew up to be a sales person but I decided that i donthave to work for anyone to bow down and say sorry about things whihc are not in my control instead work on something that gives me some sort of achievement and satisfacion.</p>

<p>early years have been hard for me over past 8 years or so, Been working and working but got no where took time off from work and did a lot of experiments and finally I stumbled onto Webdevelopment whihc i think would make a great new path for me, I belive i may do wonders if i pursue this path. at the end of the day i wanna be my own boss and be satisfied with what i do. kudos and cheers to new beginning, Also Im an hardcore Star wars fan do not be alarmed if you find my portfolio full of star wars references. :P </p>
